Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements



Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs

Functional Requirements:

1: LIS should provide registration functionality.

2: LIS should provide login functionality. Registered Users can login and logout.

3: LIS should provide searching/browsing of books for Registered as well as         non-Registered Users.

4: The LIS system should provide the information related to books and authors to Registered as well as non-Registered Users.

5: Using the LIS system only  Registered users can borrow(or return it) the books from anywhere.  

6: The LIS system should check that a book is available or not before assigning a book to the user and also gives a day limit for borrowing of books . 

7: Using LIS  User should be able to extend the date of borrowing the book if no other request is made by another user for that particular book.

8: LIS system should be able to distinguish between different types of Users(like: visitor , administrative, Registered user etc. )and provide privileges accordingly.

9: Users who have administrative privileges should be able to insert , update and delete records of books in the system.





Non - Functional Requirements:

1: System should be secure.

2: System should be able to manage a large number of users.

3: System should be easy to access from different locations.

4: System should be user friendly.

5: System should be able to do concurrency control so many users can use the LIS system at the same time.

6: System should be able to manage errors.

Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

Identify scope

The scope of this project is to make a mobile application that addresses the everyday needs of people with disabling hearing loss.The app will be available for android devices. And applications use artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest.

Features:

1: App is available for android devices.

2: Recognition of key sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community, such as car horns and babies.

3: Immediate alerts when key sound events are detected.

4: Continual logging of sound events for the user.
